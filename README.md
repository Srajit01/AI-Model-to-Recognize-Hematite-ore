# AI-Model-to-Recognize-Hematite-ore
Project Descriptions at First is to Gather a large dataset of project descriptions that are relevant to mining and geology , particularly those mentioning various ores including Hematite.



1) Labeling is next to Label the data to indicate whether the project description mentions Hematite or not. This may involve identifying keywords, phrases, or specific contexts where Hematite is referenced.

2) Text Preprocessing
Tokenization and understanding the Break down the project descriptions into words or tokens.
Stop Words Removal like Remove common words that do not contribute much to the meaning (like "and," "the," etc.).
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form (e.g., "mining" to "mine").


3) Model Selection
Classical Models to Use models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Naive Bayes, which are commonly used for text classification.
Deep Learning Models are More complex models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) can be used, particularly if you have a large dataset. Pre-trained models like BERT or GPT can also be fine-tuned for this task.


4) Training and Validation
Training you model Train the model on a subset of your labeled data.
Validation: Use another subset to validate the modelâ€™s performance. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are essential here.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust model parameters to improve performance.

5) Testing
Test the model on unseen data to evaluate its generalizability.
Ensure that it correctly identifies project descriptions that mention Hematite ore.


6) Deployment
Once the model performs well, deploy it in an environment where it can process new project descriptions and identify those relevant to Hematite.
